# VNF Scheduler
This app is a custom scheduler that determines where virtual network functions should be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. As part of this project, I built custom images (ex. Intrusion detection system) and deployed them as k8s pods, and created a way to use these in an application. 
You can see an algorithm in the repo that I created, and used in the Kubernetes scheduler.
